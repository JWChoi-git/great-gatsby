
 In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice: always try to see the best in people, he would say...
 
 As a consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgements.
 
 But even I... have a limit.
 
 Back then all of us drank too much.
 
 The more in tune with the times we were, the more we drank.
 
 And none of us contributed anything new.
 
 When I came back from New York I was disgusted.
 
 Disgusted... with everyone, and everything... Only one man was exempt from my disgust.
 
 One man...? Mr. Carraway?
 
 Gatsby...
 
 Was he a friend of yours?
 
 He was... the single most hopeful person I have ever met... And am ever likely to meet again. There was something about him...
 
 A sensitivity. He was like one of those machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away...
 
 Where did you meet him?
 
 At a party. In New York.
 
 the city approached hysteria...
 
 Stocks hit record peaks. And Wall Street boomed, in a steady golden roar...
 
 The parties were bigger; the shows were broader; the buildings were higher; the morals were looser; and the ban on alcohol had backfired...
 making the liquor cheaper.
 
 Wall Street was luring the young and ambitious.
 
 And I was one of them.
 
 I rented a house twenty miles from the city, on Long Island.
 
 I lived at West Egg...
 .
 
 ...in a forgotten grounds-keeper's cottage squeezed among the mansions of the newly rich.
 
 To get started, I bought a dozen volumes on credit, banking and INVESTMENTS-
 All new to me...
 The stock market hit another record high today!
 It's like pickin' up money in the street!
 I got a dandy tip on Burlington; who's comin with me?!
 
 Yes sir, of course nothing is one hundred percent. Well, I wouldn't go investing every penny. But...
 
 
 At Yale, I'd dreamed of being a writer.
 
 But I gave all that up.
 
 With the sun shining and the great bursts of leaves on the trees, I planned to spend the summer studying.
 
 And I probably would have-
 Were it not for the riotous amusements that beckoned from beyond the walls of that colossal castle...
 
 Owned by a gentleman I had not yet met, named...
 
 
 Gatsby.
 
 So... He was your neighbor?
 
 My neighbor? No, Gatsby was-- Well-If I think about it... The history of the summer really began the night I drove over to my cousin Daisy's for dinner...
 
 She lived across the bay...
 
 In old money East Egg.
 
 Her husband was heir to one of America's wealthiest families.
 
 His name was Tom Buchanan.
 
 
 When we were at Yale together he'd been a sporting star.
 
 But now his glory days were behind him and he contented himself with... other affairs.
 
 I thought I told you not to call me here...!
 
 Shakespeare! How's the great American novel coming...?
 
 Oh, I'm selling bonds now Tom...
 with Walter Chase's outfit-
 Never heard of em.
 
 Hey! What say after dinner we go into town?
 
 CAN'T-
 Catch up with the old wolf pack?
 
 Big day on the new job tomorrow-8
 
 Nonsense! We're going.
 
 First team, all-American!
 
 You see? Made me who I am today.
 
 Here-- Forest Hills... I played the Prince of Wales. What a sissy!
 
 Life's something you dominate Nick.
 
 If you're any good.
 
 Ha-ha-ha!
 
 Oh Nicky... Is that you my lovely?
 
 Daisy Buchanan. The golden girl. A breathless warmth flowed from her.
 A promise that there was no one else in the world she so wanted to see...
 
 Do they miss me in Chicago?
 
 Oh, yes. About a dozen people send their love.
 
 How gorgeous.
 
 They're absolutely in mourning...
 They're crying...
 
 NO--
 
 They're wailing...
 
 NO--
 
 They're screaming, they're shouting...
 
 NO--
 
 Daisy Buchanan, we can't live without you!
 
 I'm p-paralyzed with happiness...!
 
 Jordan Baker; a very famous golfer.
 
 She was the most frightening person I'd ever seen-
 I've seen your face on the cover of Sporting Life. Nick Carraway...
 
 But I enjoyed looking at her.
 
 I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember...
 
 I know! This summer I'll sort of, fling you and Jordan together...
 
 I'll push you into linen closets, and out to sea in boats...
 
 I'm not listening to a word!
 
 Nick, Daisy tells me you're over at WEST EGG; 
 throwing your lot in with those social-climbing, primitive New Money types...?
 
 Well, my little shack is cardboard box at eighty a month.
 
 Your life is adorable.
 
 I know somebody in West Egg.
 
 I don't know a single-
 Oh, you must know Gatsby.
 
 Gatsby?
 
 What Gatsby...?
 
 Madame, le diner est servi!
 
 Would you like to hear a family secret? Its about the butler's nose...
 
 Things went from bad to worse...
 
 Nicky... I heard a rumor, that you were getting married to a girl out west...
 
 Its a libel, I'm too poor.
 
 They have to be old so they die quickly...
 
 Can't we talk about something else?
 Anything? Crops? You're making me feel uncivilized Daisy-
 Civilization's going to pieces!
 Have you read 'The Rise of the Colored Empires' by this fellow Goddard?
 
 Why no...
 
 Everyone ought to read it. The idea is that its up to us, the dominant race, to watch out, or these other races...
 
 Will have control of things.
 
 Tom's been very profound lately. He reads deep books with long words in THEM
 
 It's been proved. Its scientific.
 
 We've got to beat them down.
 
 Excuse me... I'll be right back.
 
 I'm sorry...
 
 Well, this Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor...
 
 Shhhh... Don't talk. I want to hear what happens.
 
 Is something happening?
 
 I thought everybody knew.
 
 I don't.
 
 Tom's got some woman in New York.
 
 Got some woman?
 
 She might have the decency not to telephone at dinner-time... Don't you think?
 
 I just love seeing you at my table Nicky. You remind me of a rose, an absolute rose... Doesn't he?
 
 I'm not even faintly like a rose-
 So... After dinner Nick wanted to go into town. Right Nick? To the Yale club.
 
 Nicky, stay-
 I have to work early.
 
 Nonsense. Its only for a drink or two.
 
 None of us could ignore that fifth guest's shrill metallic urgency...
 
 Oh Nicky...
 
 What?
 
 Its just, well, you see, I think everything's terrible anyhow. You know I've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything, and I've had very bad time Nicky... I'm pretty cyncical about everything.
 
 Your daughter; I suppose she talks, and... eats, and everything?
 
 Pammy? Oh yes...
 
 Listen Nick, when she was born, Tom was God knows where - with God knows whom - and I asked the nurse if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and I wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.'
 
 All the bright precious things fade so fast...
 
 And they don't come back.
 
 When I arrived home I noticed that a figure had emerged on my neighbor's dock.
 
 And something told me it was... Mr.
 Gatsby.
 
 He seemed to be... reaching toward something out there in the dark.
 
 The green light.
 
 Green light?
 
 I don't want to talk about this Doctor.
 
 I can't talk about THIS.
 
 Then write about it.
 
 Write?
 
 Yes. Write.
 
 Why would I do that?
 
 After all, you said that writing brought you solace, once upon a time.
 
 Yeah, well. It didn't bring anyone else much solace... I wasn't any good.
 
 No one need ever read it. You can always burn it.
 
 What would I write about?
 
 Anything. Whatever you can't quite talk about; a memory; a thought; a place... Write it down.
 
 A place...
 
 The Valley of Ashes was a grotesque place...
 
 New York's dumping ground, half way between West Egg and the city...
 
 ...Where the burnt out coal that powered the booming, golden city was discarded by men who moved dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.
 
 ...This fantastic farm was everwatched by Dr. T. J. Eckleberg...
 
 ...A forgotten oculist whose eyes brooded over it all like the eyes of God.
 
 Tom had invited me to town, on the pretense of a lunch at the Yale Club....
 
 But the day took an unexpected turn...
 
 Come on--!
 
 What are we doing?
 
 Trust me!
 
 Wait a second would you!?
 
 Dominate Nick! Dominate!
 
 Hello Wilson! How's business?
 
 I can't complain. When are you going to sell me that car?
 
 I've got my man working on it.
 
 Works pretty slow, don't he?
 
 Maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else?
 
 I don't mean that, I just...
 20
 
 If its business you're talking, you should be talking to me...
 Get some chairs why don't you; so somebody can sit down...
 
 Hurry up!
 
 Oh, sure... Sure...
 
 Mrs. Wilson... Nick Carraway.
 
 A pleasure...
 
 Nick's a writer...
 
 I'm in bonds, actually...
 
 Get on the next train.
 
 Now...? Are we gettin' that dog?
 
 Whatever you want. And you can call up your sister...
 She'll like him...
 
 Oh no, that's alright, I'm busy...
 
 Catherine's said to be very good looking, by people who oughta know.
 
 Really I can't...
 
 Do you want to embarrass Myrtle...?
 That's rude.
  I'm Catherine; ain't we havin' a party?
 
 Oh, I'm... I'm not sure now's a good time-- I was just going- Hello...!
  Chester McKee, pleasure to meet you.
 
 Nick Carraway.
 22
  Where're the kids?
  What's the matter? Don't ya like me?
  Myrtle Turtle...! Oh, that dress is adorable!
 
 It's just a crazy old thing. I slip it on when I don't care what I look like!
 
 Get some ice Myrtle, before everyone goes to sleep.
 
 Tom, I really should be going...
 
 Nonsense...
 
 Tom; I don't think-- Daisy's my-
 Listen Nick, you like to watch; I remember that from college. And that's OK, I make no judgment; but we've got a whole summer - do you want to sit on the sideline and watch, or do you want to play ball?
  Yeah. Ain't we good enough for ya?
 23
  Take off yer hat and stay awhile...
 
 Hey Nick! McKee's in the artistic game.
 
 Photography.
 
 Nick's artistic.
 
 No...
 
 Really?
 
 Ah, no, well, I write a little...
  Do you live on Long Island, too?
 
 I live at West Egg.
  Really? I was there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby's. Do you know him?
 
 I live right next door to him...
  He's a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's.
 You know, the evil German king...


 Hey McKee, take a picture of that!
 
 Oh, don't!
 24
 
 I'm not one of those models...! But you can if you want...
  Neither of them can stand who they're married to.
 
 Doesn't she like Wilson either?
 
 ...He's a greasy little scumbag!
  No thanks; I feel just as good on nothing at all...
  Nerve pills, I get them from a doctor in Queens. You want one?
 
 My nerves are fine thanks...
 
 I had been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon...
 
 That night, in the hidden flat that Tom kept for Myrtle, we were buoyed by a sort of chemical madness, a willingness of the heart that burst thunderously upon us all... And suddenly, I began to like New York.
 25
 
 ...I've got to get a massage, and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's grave!
 
 My dear I'm giving you this dress!
 MRS. MCKEE Adorable! Adorable!
 
 High over the city our yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrets to the casual watcher in the street...
 
 ...and I was him too, looking up and wondering...
 
 I was within and without; enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life...
 26
 
 You've got no right to speak her name!
 
 Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! I'll speak it whenever I want! Daisy! Dai-
 I have no clue how I got home.
 
 But I do know that I awoke with a distinctly uneasy feeling...
 
 ....that Gatsby was watching me.
 27	.
 
 Watching you...?
 
 Yes. He was watching me. In fact, I know now that Gatsby was always watching me...
 
 And how do you know that?
 
 Because I got an invitation... I was the only one.
 
 No one, except me, every received an actual invitation to Gatsby's...
 
 You see, the rest of New York simply came, uninvited...
 
 The whole city packed into automobiles and all weekend, every weekend, ended up at Gatsby's...
 28
 
 And I mean everyone: from every walk of life, from every corner of New York City, this kaleidoscopic carnival spilled through Gatsby's door...
 
 A caravansary of...
 
 Billionaire play-boy publishers, and their blond nurses... Heiresses comparing inheritances on Gatsby's beach... My boss, Walter Chase, losing money at the roulette tables... Gossip columnists...
 Alongside gangsters and governors exchanging telephone numbers...
 Silent film stars... Broadway directors... Morality protectors...
 Casino collectors...
 
 Underage hecklers... And Ewing Klipspringer, dubious descendent of Beethoven!
 
 Do you know where I might find the host, Mr. Gatsby?
 
 I live just next door...
  Mr. Gatsby? I've never seen him sir. Why, no one has...
 
 Alone, and a little embarrassed, I decided to get... roaring drunk.
 
 Wow.
 
 I thought I might see you here...
 
 Hello.
 
 I remembered you lived next door...
 
 Its like... an amusement park.
 3	0
 
 Shall we?
 
 Did you get an invitation?
 
 People aren't invited to Gatsby's.
 
 Well I was... I seem to be the only one. Who is this Gatsby?
 
 He was a German spy during the war.
 
 Teddy Barton. Nick Carraway.
 
 A German spy...?
 
 No, no, no, no. He's the Kaiser's assassin.
  I heard he killed a man once.
 
 Its true!
  You look at him sometimes when he thinks no one's watching... I'll bet he killed a man.
 
 Kills for fun! Free of charge.
 
 Well he's already richer than God.
 
 You don't believe he killed a man do you...?
 
 Let's go find him, and you can ask him yourself...
 
 Oh, Mr. Gatsby...!
 Shall I lead you into his clutches?
  You won't find him...!
  This house and everything in it, are all part of an elaborate disguise. But Mr. Gatsby doesn't exist.
 
 Phooey; I've met him!
  Which one; the Prince, the Spy, the Murderer? I've been wandering his halls drunk for about a week now but no matter where I look, I can't find anyone who knows anything real about Mr. Gatsby.
 32
 
 Well I don't care; he gives large parties - and I like large parties, they're so intimate; at small parties there isn't any privacy.
 
 But if that's true; what's all this for...?
  That, my dear fellow, is the question...
 
 I didn't expect all this...
 
 What did you expect?
 
 I don't know...
 
 Disappointed?
 
 Not in the slightest...
 
 Penny-less pantywaist!
 33
 
 I'm stealing her away Carraway!
  Ladies and gentlemen, please make your way to the grand terrazzo; for the premiere of Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's A Jazz History of the World, and accompanying fireworks!
 
 Look around you! Rich girls don't marry poor boys-
 Your face is familiar. Weren't you in the Third Division during the war?
 
 Yes; The Ninth Battalion.
 
 I was in the Seventh. I knew I'd seen you somewhere before... Having a good time, old sport?
 
 The whole thing's incredible - I live next door...
 CRUMPLED INVITATION) He even sent me an invitation, but I still haven't met Mr. Gatsby, no one's met him; they say he's third cousin to the Kaiser and second cousin to the devil!
 34
 
 I'm afraid I'm not a very good host, old sport... I'm Gatsby.
 
 Oh.. I'm very sorry-- I... I've had so much to drink...
 
 I thought you knew, old sport.
 
 His smile was one of those rare smiles that you may come across four or five times in life. It seemed to understand you and believe in you just as you would like to be understood and believed in.
 
 Excuse me sir; Chicago on the wire.
 
 I'm trying out my new hydroplane in the morning. Want to go with me, old sport?
 
 What time?
 
 Any time that suits you.
 
 Lovely to see you Miss Baker.
 35
 
 If you need anything, just ask for it, old sport. I will rejoin you later... Excuse me.
 
 I expected him to be...
 
 Old and fat?
 
 Well, yes; young men don't just drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island.
 
 He told me once he was an Oxford man. However, I don't believe it...
 
 Why not?
 
 I don't know... I just don't believe he went there...
 
 I beg your pardon...
 
 Miss Baker; Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you... Alone.
 
 Me?
 
 Yes, madame.
 36	.
 
 Nick! Nick! I've just heard the most shocking thing; it all makes sense...
 
 Where have you been!? The car's waiting!
 as Jordan calls back...
 
 Simply amazing! It all makes sense.
 It all makes sense...
 
 What makes sense...?
 
 Everything... But here I am tantalizing you...
 
 And I swore I wouldn't tell.
 3	7
 
 But...
 
 Nick. I'm sorry, I swore I wouldn't tell.
 
 Sorry to keep her from you, old sport. Don't forget; we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning.
 
 Philadelphia on the phone, sir.
 
 Good night, old sport...
 
 Good night. Thank you.
  Whazza matter!? We run outta gas!?
 
 Come and see me... We'll have tea!
 I'm in the phone-book!
 38	.
 
 We rode in the hydroplane... And I attended two more of his parties, even made use of his beach. But I soon realized that I knew absolutely nothing about Gatsby at all, until...
 
 Its pretty isn't it, old sport...?
 Haven't you seen it before? Its all a custom job. Supercharged engine.
 Get dressed... We're having lunch!

 Ah... well... Ah... Look here, old sport... What's your opinion of me, anyhow?
 
 My... opinion?
 
 Yes, yes, your opinion!
 
 I don't want you to get the wrong impression from all those bizarre accusations you must be hearing. A pack of lies I assure you. You've heard the stories...?
 
 WELL--
 
 I'll tell you God's truth. God's truth about myself!
 I am the son of some very wealthy people from the Middle-West; sadly, all dead now... I was brought up in America, but educated at Oxford; because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. You see, it's a... a family tradition.
 
 The way he spoke... No wonder people thought he was lying...
 
 After that I lived like a young Prince in all the capitals of Europe!
 
 Europe?
 
 Yes, Europe! Paris; Venice; Rome; Vienna, Zurich, Helsinki...
 Collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting, a little, things for myself mostly, and trying to forget something very sad that happened to me long ago...
 40	.
 
 Then came the war, old sport...
 
 Just when I thought it couldn't be any more fantastical...
 
 It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life...
 
 He became a war hero, singlehandedly defeating the German army!
 
 In the Argonne Forest I took my machine gun detachment so far forward... We were outnumbered five to one. There was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance. We stayed there two days and two guns...
 
 ...When the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of 3 German divisions among the piles of the dead.
 
 I was promoted to Major and every Allied government gave me a decoration; even Montenegro! Little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea.
 
 Here! That's the one from Montenegro.
 
 Turn it.
 
 Major Jay Gatsby. For Valor Extraordinary.
 
 That's right.
 
 Here's another thing that I always carry. A souvenir of my Oxford days; the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.
 
 What could I say...? The photograph was undoubtedly authentic. Could it all be true?
 
 But don't take my word for it. At lunch, I'm going to introduce you to one of New York's most distinguished businessmen; my friend, Mr. Meyer Wolfsheim, who will confirm all I've told you, and vouch for my good character...
 42	.
 
 I'm sure that's not necessary...
 
 Oh but it is though...! You see, I thought you ought to know something about my life. I... I don't want you to think I'm just some... some nobody. You see, old sport, I'm going to make a very big request of you today.
 
 A big request?
 
 Yes. Yes... Miss Baker will explain everything when you take her to tea this afternoon.
 
 Jordan...? What's she got to do with it?
 
 Oh, I assure you it's nothing underhand. Miss Baker's an honest sportswoman; she'd never do anything that wasn't alright...
 
 Pull over!!! Pull over to the curb!
 
 All right, old sport! Alright.
 
 Right you are... Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!
 43	.
 
 One of your old Oxford pals?
 
 Well... actually, I was able to do the Commissioner a favor once; he sends a Christmas card every year.
 I imagine he'll be at lunch too...
 
 By the time we reached the bridge I was impossibly confused...
 
 I didn't know what to think... But the city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world. Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge, I thought; anything at all...
 
 Even Gatsby could happen...
 44
  Ah my boy...!
 
 Meyer, Meyer...
  You smell so good.
 
 Mr. Carraway; my friend, Mr.
 Wolfsheim.
  A wonderful pleasure, Mr. Carraway.
 I know all about you.
 
 Really?
 
 Of course! Mr. Gatsby is always talking about you.
  Come, join us for a little lunch...
 45
  Tell Walter Chase; he shuts his mouth or he doesn't get a penny...
 
 We'll talk about that later...
  Highballs, Mr. Gatsby?
 
 Yes, highballs it is.
 You take good care of my friend here!
  Hey Jay...! You're under arrest!!!
 
 You be careful now. You're turning into a real Jazz-Hound Commissioner.
 See, that's the Commissioner back there.
 
 You be careful at those tables now Senator!
  Of course! I'll put a bet on for you Jay!
 46
 
 Shall we order?
 Lobster tails all round.
 They decorate it with truffle slices and fine herbs. Very artistic.
  So... How is the bond business Mr.
 Carraway?
 
 It's fine, thank you.
  I understand you're looking for a BUSINESS GONNEGTION-
 No, no. This isn't the man. This is the friend I told you about.
  Oh! Beg your pardon, I had a wrong man.
 
 Now, if you'll excuse me. I have to make THAT call.
 Meyer, do you mind?
  Gatsby! What a gentleman! From one of the finest families in the Midwest... Sadly all dead now. Let me tell you, when I made the pleasure of Mr. Gatsby's acquaintance just after the war, I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding. A war hero! Such...
 medals. And, an Oggsford man.
 Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford?
 47
 
 I've heard of it...

 Then you would know that a man like that can be trusted. With a friend, with someone like you, he would never so much as look at your wife...
 
 I'm not... married.
  But you work on Wall Street, right?
 
 Yes...
  Looking at my tiepin?
  Finest specimen of human molars...
  Gentlemen. Everything alright...?
 
 Oh, yes... We were just talking about other people's wives...
  Other people's wives? Ah... I see.
  Other people's wives... Meyer?
  Well, my work here is done. I'll leave you gentlemen to talk about your sports and your women...
 48
  You'll have to excuse him... In his old age, he's prone to digress...
 He's a regular around here; a real denizen of Broadway...
 
 Who is he anyhow?
  Meyer? He's a gambler.
 
 An actor?
  Meyer? No. He's the man who fixed 
 Fixed it?
  Fixed it.
 
 How did he manage that?
  He just... saw the opportunity, I suppose. He's a very smart man.
 Now, old sport, about Miss Baker, and that request we spoke of...
 
 Hey Nick! Nick! Where've you been!?
 Daisy's furious you haven't called up.
 
 This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.
 4	9
  I'm so very, very... delighted to make your acquaintance.
 
 I wouldn't have expected to find you in this temple of virtue.
 
 I'm having lunch with Mr. Gats-
 I'm looking for Ms. Baker. Yes. The famous sporting star. The golfer...
 There... I've spotted her.
 
 What game are you and Gatsby playing at!?
 MAITRE'D Will the gentleman be joining?
 
 One moment please- Please, Nick, sit down. This is a polite restaurant.
 50	.
 
 It's all very strange. He picks me up in his fancy yellow car... And he's going on and on and on about his life and the war and rubies and Oxford and... What is- If you'll just have a seat-
 What is this big request!?
  Nick--! He just wants you to invite Daisy to tea.
 
 Tea?
 Daisy...? And Gatsby...?
 
 Why?
  Well... I don't know quite where to start. You see... I met Gatsby, five years ago, in Louisville...
  It was the day I got my new English golf shoes.
  Daisy was by far the most popular girl with the Officers from Camp Taylor...
  One of them was in the car with her.
  It was Gatsby. And the way he looked at her...
  Is the way all girls want to be looked at.
 
 So what happened?
  Well, I don't know...
  Gatsby was sent off to war...
  But when the war ended... For some unknown reason, Gatsby couldn't return...
 5	2
  A year later, Tom Buchanan of Chicago swept in and stole her away...
  He gave her a string of pearls worth $350,000.
  But, the morning of the wedding, Daisy received a letter...
 
 Tell them Daisy's changed her mind!
  Daisy! Please, everyone's waiting!
  Give them back!!
 What on earth is going on in here!?
 53	.
 
 Leave me alone!
 'S MOTHER Jordan, run the bath! Now!
 
 What was in the letter?
  I don't know. She wouldn't tell me.
  Anyways, that day, at five o'clock, Daisy Faye married Tom Buchanan with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville had ever seen...
  After the honeymoon, I saw them in Santa Barbara. It was touching, actually...
 54
  I'd never seen a girl so in love with her husband.
 A week later, Tom crashed his car.
 The girl with him was a chambermaid at the Santa Barbara Hotel. It got into all the papers...
 
 It's a strange coincidence, isn't it? Gatsby's house being just across the bay...
  It's no coincidence. He bought that house to be near her, he threw all those parties hoping she'd wander in one night. He constantly asked about Daisy... I was the first one who knew her.
 
 All that for a girl he hasn't seen in five years...? And now he just wants me to have her for tea...?
 The modesty of it.
  Kind of takes your breath away, doesn't it?
 TAXI DRIVER Evening sweethearts! Where to?
  Long Island, please.
 55	.
 
 And you think I should? I mean, does Daisy want to see Gatsby?
  She's absolutely not to know. You are just supposed to invite her over so he can happen to drop by.
 
 I remember feeling torn. Was it right to bring my cousin Daisy, a married woman, together with a man I hardly knew?
 
 When I returned home, Gatsby's was lit, from tower to cellar, as if for another wild party. But...
 There wasn't a sound.
 
 Your place looks like the World's Fair... or Coney Island!
  Ah, does it? I've... I've just been glancing into some rooms... Let's go to Coney Island, old sport, we can take my car-
 It's too late tonight.
 56
  Or we can take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven't made use of it all summer...
 
 I must go to bed...
 
 Happy to do it. Jay-- I'm going to call Daisy and invite her to tea.
  Oh, that's alright. I don't want to put you to any trouble...
 
 What day would suit you?
  What day would suit you...? I don't want to put you to any trouble...
 
 Day after tomorrow alright?
  Day after tomorrow? Well, I'd...
 I'd want to get the grass cut.
  There's another little thing... I thought-- Look here, old sport-You don't make much money, do you?
 
 Not really.
  If you'll pardon my... You see, I carry on a little business on the side - a sort of sideline - you understand what I'm saying right?
 You're selling bonds, aren't you, old sport?
 
 Trying to.
 57	.
  Well, this might interest you... It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing... But you might pick up a nice bit of money.
 
 I've got my hands full.
  You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfsheim. I assure you.
 
 No, no, no... Its a favor Jay. Just a favor.
 
 Happy to do it.
  A favor?
 
 Yes.
  Ah, right, right... Goodnight.
 
 Goodnight.
 58	.
  One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was the Journal...
 
 The grass looks fine.
  Grass?
  What Grass?
  Have you got everything you need?
 
 Perhaps more flowers?
  I think they did a fine job, don't you?
 
 Beautiful.
  You think it's too much?
 
 I think it's what you want.
  I think so too... She'll be impressed, won't she old sport?
 
 I am.
  I can't wait all day. I'm leaving!
 
 Don't be silly. It's just two minutes to four...
  Nobody's coming to tea. It's too late!
 
 It's her.
 
 Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?
 60
 
 Why did I have to come alone? Are you in love with me?
 
 That's the secret of Carraway Castle.
 Tell your chauffeur to go far away.
 
 Come back in an hour, Ferdie!
 His name is Ferdie.
 
 Oh--! Oh, my goodness. I... I can't believe it. You-- Did you ransack a greenhouse?
 
 He is in love with me...
 
 That's funny.
 
 What's funny?
 
 One moment...
 
 What are you doing?
 
 I'm certainly glad to see you again.
  I'm... certainly glad to see you as well.
  We've met before...
 6	2
  Ah... sorry...
 
 It's an old... clock.
 
 Lovely though. A lovely... clock.
 
 We haven't met for many years.
  Five years next November.
 
 Tea?
  Thank you old sport.
 
 Darling thank you.
 
 I just need to... pop into town.
  Town...?
 
 The village; I'll be right back.
  I've got to speak to you...!
  Oh, God! This is a mistake, a terrible, terrible mistake...
 
 You're just embarrassed, that's all... Daisy's embarrassed too.
  She's embarrassed?
 
 Just as much as you are.
  Don't talk so loud!
 
 You're acting like a little boy!
 You're rude. Daisy's in there all alone and...
 
 Looking over my story so far, I'm reminded that for the second time that summer...
 
 I was guarding other people's secrets.
 64
 
 Once again I was within...
 
 And without...
 
 Its... stopped raining.
  Yes, it has...
 Hasn't it?
  What do you think of that, Daisy?
 Come look.
 
 Look. Its my house. Just there across the bay...
  I know. I have the same view from my place.
 
 Where's your place?
 65	.
  Nick, I want you and Daisy both to see my house. I'd like to show her around.
 
 Are you sure you want me to come?
  Absolutely, old sport. Absolutely.
  I had the gates brought in from a castle in Normandy.
 
 Oh, Jay...!? Its so grand!
  Do you like it?
 
 I love it...! But how do you live here all alone?
  I don't. I keep it always full of interesting, celebrated people...
  My house looks well doesn't it? See how the whole front catches the light like that?

 Come on you two! I want the royal tour!
 6	6
  You must understand, I like all things that are modern.
  If you press this button here, the oranges shoot through here, are crushed there... The juice of 200 oranges extracted in one hour...!
  Its a remarkable little camera-latest design.
 
 You do know, I'm a champion golfer, don't you? Here, I'll show you how its done.
 67	.
  She looks like she could be on the cover of Vogue, don't you think...?
 
 Oh...! Its beautiful.
  Its a custom Wurlitzer.
 
 Can anyone play it?
  Klipspringer can.
 Someone wake Ewing!
 
 Music! And we can dance all night!
  Ewing's a symphonic genius, he can play anything...!
 
 Then I demand a Charleston!
  She makes it look so splendid, don't you think old sport?
 68
  I've got a man in England who buys me clothes...!
  Something for the lady...
 
 I've never seen anything like it!
  He sends over a selection at the beginning of each season...
 
 Jay!
  These are silk! Linen! Indian flannel! Egyptian cotton!
 
 No, Jay... you'll ruin them!
 Nicky! He's a madman!
  What is it?
 
 It's just... It makes me sad, because...
  Why?
 
 ...because...
 
 Five lost years struggled on Daisy's lips. But all she could manage was...
 
 It's just... Because I've never seen such beautiful shirts before.
  If it wasn't for the mist we could see the green light...
 
 What green light?
  The one that burns all night at the end of your dock.
 
 Possibly, it had occurred to Gatsby that the colossal significance of that light had vanished forever.
 Now, it was once again just a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.


 Who's this? Your father?
 70	.
 
 No, no.. That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport... He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.
 
 You never told me you had a pompadour... or a yacht.
 
 I want to show you something...
 Look, here's a lot of clippings, about you.
 
 You saved my letters...
 
 This was my first photo of you.
 
 We cant lose each other and let all this glorious love end in nothing.
 Come home, I'll be here waiting and hoping, for every long dream of you to come true... Come home Jay...
 NGGG! The phone shrills.
 
 Excuse me.
 
 Well I can't talk now old sport...
 
 I said a small town.
 
 He must know what a small town is.
 ! A storming wind bangs open the French windows!
 
 Well, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town...
 
 Ah, Klipspringer! He must be awake!
 Shall we?
 7	2
 
 I wish I had done everything on earth with you. All my life.
 
 I wish that it could always be like this...
 
 It will be...
 
 If only it had been enough for Gatbsy, just to hold Daisy...
 
 But he had a grand vision for his life, and Daisy's part in it.
 
 It wasn't until the end of that summer, on the last night I saw Gatsby, that he told me of the life he had dreamt for himself since he was a boy...
 73	.
 
 You see doctor... Gatsby's real name was... James Gatz.
 
 His parents were dirt-poor farmers from North Dakota...
 
 But he never accepted them as his parents at all.
 
 In his own imagination, he was... a Son of God...
 
 Destined for future glory...
 
 Chasing this destiny, a sixteen year old Gatz ran far, far away.
 74	.
 
 One afternoon, off the coast of Lake Superior, he spotted a yacht in peril...
 
 He rowed out and rescued the vessel, and its captain, alcoholic millionaire Dan Cody...
 
 Whadzamatta...?
   Sir! The shoal here's real bad, this wind could drag you onto it...
 
 Whaderathinkyerdoin..., old sport?
 
 This was his opportunity, and he seized it.
 
 I decided right then and there to call myself: Jay Gatsby.
 75	.
 
 He sailed the yacht out of danger and into his future...
 
 Gatsby showed skill and ambition, and for five years they sailed the world...
 
 He was alright, old Dan, he taught me everything...
 
 How to dress, act, and speak like a gentleman...
   Gatsby. Jay Gatsby. A pleasure to meet you, sir. Gatsby. Jay Gatsby.
 Gatsby. Jay Gatsby.
   She looks well, doesn't she...!?
 Old sport.
 76	.
 
 Gatsby hoped to inherit Cody's fortune... But when Cody died, Gatsby was cheated out of his inheritance by Cody's family...
 He'd been left with an ability to play the gentleman, but he was once again dirt poor.
 
 By midsummer Gatsby was front page news...
 
 Where did the money comes from?
 
 That's what all of New York wanted to know. And it was the same question on Tom's mind when he accompanied Daisy to one of Gatsby's glittering parties...
 77
 
 We've got a great band here. Have a look around... Excuse me...
 
 A lot of these newly rich people are just filthy bootleggers.
 
 Not Gatsby. He's a businessman.
 
 Hah! A businessman...
 
 He owned a lot of drug stores.
 
 May I introduce Senator Gulick?
 This is Mr. Carraway and Mrs.
 Buchanan...
 
 Delighted...
 
 And Mr. Buchanan...
 The polo player.
 
 Oh no. Not me.
  Always a pleasure to meet a Buchanan.
 7	8
 
 I'd rather not be the polo player.
 
 Oh Tom... You should be proud of your achievements.
 
 May I show you around?
 
 You must see the faces of a lot of people you've heard of.
 
 Absolutely!
 
 We don't go around very much. I don't think I recognize a single person...
 
 Perhaps you know that lady there?
 
 Its Marlene Moon... I adore her pictures...
 
 I'd really rather not be the polo player...
 7	9
 
 These things excite me so...
 
 I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan. About a month ago.
 
 That's right... And you were with Nick here. At the barbershop...
 
 That's right. See... I know your wife.
 
 Is that so?
 
 Yes.
 
 Mr. Gatsby sir. Mr. Slagle is here...
 
 Not now.
  And now...! Dice, Brass Knuckles and Guitars, with: The Foxtrot!
 
 Mr. Buchanan, would you mind, terribly?
 80	.
 
 Of course not; I think I can keep myself amused.
 
 In case you need to take down any addresses...
 
 Is all this made entirely from your own imagination?
 
 No... You see you were there all along, in every idea, in every decision... Of course, if anything is not to your liking, we can change it...
 
 It's perfect. From your perfect, irresistible imagination...
 
 I wonder where the devil he met Daisy...?
 
 I'll find you...
 
 Have you seen my wife...?
 
 Ah... no... Not for awhile.
 
 That's funny. The Senator said he saw her down here.
 
 I... I wish we could just run away.
 82
 
 Run away? Darling, no. Daisy, that... that wouldn't be...
 respectable.
 
 You live near here Nick...?
 
 Just next door.
 
 That so...?
 
 We're going to live here, in this house, together. You and me...
 Daisy... It's time for you to tell Tom.
 
 What a circus... Well, if you see her, I'll be looking for her. You tell her.
 83	.
 
 Remember how much fun we used to have? Why can't we just have fun like that again?
 
 Oh hello Nicky; we're having a row.
 
 What about?
 
 About things... About the future...
 The future of the Colored Empires.
 
 Well, its Tom. He's wandering around the party looking for you.
 
 Sir; it's Mr. Slagle; he's quite...
 emotional.
 
 Excuse me. Nick, would you mind?
 84	.
 
 Gatsby disappeared to deal with a dispute of some sort. Daisy waited...
 
 But Gatsby was unable to return.
  When these hot headed types appear, I rely on you... But you were not available.. A scene was made...
 What's going on with you Jay?
 
 Where were you?
 
 With Nicky. Mr. Gatsby was showing us the grounds.
 85	.
 
 Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get that menagerie together...
 
 I'd like to know who he is and what he does. And I think I'll make a point of finding out.
 
 Well there you are...! Daisy just left... But she asked me to tell you. She had a wonderful time...
 
 She didn't like it.
 
 Of course she did.
 
 No, she didn't like it. She did not have a good time. I feel so far away from her now. It's hard to make her understand.
 
 You mean about the party?
 
 The party!? I couldn't care less about the parties! You see...
 86
 
 She has to tell Tom that she never loved him.
 
 What...?
 
 Yes. Then we can go back to Louisville, to her parents' house her parents are lovely people old sport - we'll be married there...
 You see, Daisy and I are going to and start over, just as if it were five years ago.
 
 I wouldn't ask too much of her...
 
 Ask too much?
 
 No.
 
 I beg your pardon old sport. Its just.. Its so sad because its so hard to make her understand, and-
 Jay... You can't repeat the past.
 
 Can't repeat the past?
 
 No.
 
 Why of course you can. Of course you can. You'll see. I am going to fix things just the way there were before. Everything's been so... so confused since then...
 87	.
 
 He talked a lot about the past...
 As if he wanted to recover something...
 
 If I could just get back to the start... If I could just get back to the start I could find it again.
 
 Some vision of himself that he had put into loving Daisy...
 
 Five years ago Gatsby found himself at Daisy's house by colossal accident.
 
 I went to her house first with some of the other officers from Camp Taylor... I'd never been in such a beautiful house before...
 
 But his uniform his the truth. That he was a penniless young man with only that grand vision of himself.
 88	.
  MOM Daisy, don't scamper.
 There's so many dashing young officers here, and from such illustrious family's...
 
 I always knew that I could climb...
 But I could only climb if I climbed alone.
 
 I knew that, that when I kissed this girl, I would... be forever wed to her...
 
 So I stopped. And I waited... I waited...
 
 I waited for a moment longer.
 
 He knew that if he kissed this girl his mind would never again be free to romp like... the mind of God...
 That falling in love would change his destiny... forever.
 
 And then I just let myself go.
 
 She blossomed for him like a flower...
 
 And the incarnation was complete.
 
 I knew it was a great mistake for a man like me to fall in love. A great mistake. I'm only 32... I might still be a great man if I could only forget that I once lost Daisy. But my life, old sport, my life has got to be like this...
 
 It's got to keep going up.
 
 She has to go to Tom and tell him she never loved him... I need to give her more time. I just need to give her more time...
 
 Don't worry old sport, don't worry.
 I can protect her here. Good night old sport...
 
 You're wrong about the past, old sport...!
 
 You're wrong.
 
 There had been music from my neighbor's all summer. In his blue gardens, men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the laughter and the stars...
 
 Laughter... No... No... Among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars...
 
 But after Tom and Daisy visit...
 
 There were no more parties...
 
 Gatsby's lights went out one by one.
 
 Daisy visited discreetly. But...
 
 The very same fame that had once been a source of satisfaction to Jay Gatsby, became... a threat.
 
 I don't want to go home.
 
 Then don't.
 
 I've been meaning to call you up.
 I'm sorry, I've been... so busy.
 
 Is everything alright?
 
 Yes... Daisy and I are very much in love.
 
 I hear you fired all your servants?
 
 Daisy comes over sometimes in the afternoons and I wanted some people who wouldn't gossip... until we decided what we're going to do...
 You see these two towns are pretty close together. And it gets in the papers... You understand?
 They're some people Wolfsheim wanted to do something for.
 
 What's the difference as long as they can cook and make beds...?
 
 Nick... Daisy's ready. Shes ready.
 But there's just one thing. She's requested that you and Miss Baker be there, at lunch tomorrow, at her house... Will you come, old sport?
 Daisy needs you. I... We need you.
 Will you come old sport?
 
 You know, I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year...
 
 Or wait a minute; it's the opposite...
 
 The sun is getting colder every year...


 How I'd like to be out on that bay today.
 
 I'm right across from you.
 Right there.
 
 So you are.
 
 Every night I can see that light at the end of your dock, blinking.
 
 What light?
 
 You see, Mr. Buchanan, I wanted to be close-- Daisy and I-
 It's so hot...
 
 Everything's so confused.
 
 What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon...? And the day after that...
 ...and for the next thirty years?
 Let's all go to town! Who wants to go to town?
 
 Town!? Women... They get these notions...
 
 Daisy...
 
 You look so cool. You always look so cool, like the advertisement of the man... in Times Square...
 
 The man in the cool, beautiful, shirts.
 
 She had told Gatsby that she loved him - and Tom had seen...
 
 Let's go to town! I'm perfectly willing...! That's a marvelous idea! Henri! Have the car brought around immediately!
 
 Just like that? Can't anyone at least have a cigarette?
 
 We've smoked all through lunch.
 
 Oh, let's have fun. It's too hot to fuss.
 
 It was your great idea Daisy. Why don't we!? We'll all go to town!
 
 I've changed my mind...
 You brute.
 
 You've got me all excited, and now you don't want to go? We'll get a great big room at the Plaza, a cold bucket of ice, and some whiskey...
 It will be fun.
 
 Fine. Have it your own way, Tom...
 Come on, Jordan.
 
 Will you join us, Mr. Gatsby?
 
 Henri! Get some whiskey! Two bottles, wrapped in a towel.
 
 Mr. Gatsby! Would you be good enough to take my coup ? And I'll drive everyone else in your circus wagon.
 
 I don't think there's much gas, old sport.
 
 Plenty of gas. And if we run out, then we'll stop at a drug store.
 I hear you can buy anything at a drug store nowadays...
 Isn't that right, Mr. Gatsby?
 
 You take Nick and Jordan, Tom!
 
 We'll meet you at the Plaza! I'll be the man on the corner smoking two cigarettes...
 
 You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you? But I have a-- an almost second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. And I've made a small investigation of this fellow.
 
 And you found he was an Oxford man?
 
 Oxford, New Mexico! He wears a pink suit for Christ's sake!
 
 We're almost out of gas Tom...
 
 Wilson! Wilson! What are you waiting for!? Let's have some gas...
 Do I have to do it myself?
 
 I'm sick. I'm all run down. I need money bad... My wife and I want to go West.
 
 Your wife does...?
 
 Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His mistress and wife, an hour ago so secure, were both slipping from his control...
 
 I just got wised-up to something funny the last two days. She's goin' whether she wants to or not.
 
 What do I owe you!?
 
 Dollar twenty.
 
 You can have the car! I'll send it around tomorrow!
 
 That's enough...
 
 Open another window.
 
 There aren't any more.
 
 Then telephone for an axe...
 
 Forget about the heat. You make it worse by crabbing about it.
 
 Why not let her alone, old sport?
 
 That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?
 
 What is?
 
 'Old sport'. Where'd you pick it up?
 
 Now see here, Tom; if you're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here one minute.
 
 Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man.
 
 No, not exactly.
 
 Oh yes, I understand you went to Oxford.
 
 Yes - I went there.
 
 Sure; the man in the pink suit went to Oxford!
 
 Tom...!
 
 I told you I went there.
 
 I heard you, but I'd like to know when.
 
 You'd like to know when....? It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I can't exactly call myself an Oxford man.
 
 You see, it was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers who actually fought in the war.
 
 I wanted to get up and slap Gatsby on the back.
 
 I'll make you a drink Tom, then you won't seem so stupid to yourself...
 
 Wait a minute, I want to ask Mr.
 Gatsby one more question.
 
 Go on. Please Mr. Buchanan, go on.
 
 What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?
 
 He isn't causing a row; you're causing a row. Please have a little self-control!
 
 Self-control! I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr.
 Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife? Well, if that's the idea you can count me out... See, nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next you know they'll throw everything overboard and we'll have intermarriage between black and white!
 
 We're all white here, Tom.
 
 Your wife doesn't love you. She's never loved you. She loves me!
 
 You must be crazy.
 
 No, old sport. See, she never loved you... She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting. It was a terrible, terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone but me!
 
 We should go...
 
 Daisy and I have nothing to hide...
 
 Jay let's go, please...!
 
 Sit down Daisy!
 
 Yes, Daisy, please sit down.
 
 What's been going on? I want to hear all about it.
 
 I just told you what's been going on; its been going on for five years...!
 
 You've been seeing him for five years?
 
 Not seeing. No, we couldn't; but both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh sometimes, to think that you didn't know...
 
 Oh - that's all; you're crazy! I can't speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn't know Daisy then - but I'll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that's a god-damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.
 
 No...
 
 She does, though... And what's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time...
 
 You're revolting...
 
 Do you know why we left Chicago...?
 I'm surprised they didn't treat you to the story of that little spree.
 
 That's all over now. Just tell him the truth, that you never loved him; and all this... all this pain will be wiped out forever.
 
 Why, how could I love him, possibly?
 
 You never loved him.
 
 I never loved him.
 
 That's right...
 
 Not at Kapiolani?
 
 No.
 
 Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry...? Daisy? Never?
 
 Please don't.
 
 Daisy...
 
 There, Jay.
 
 You want too much! I love you now; isn't that enough? I can't help what's past.
 I did love him once; but I loved you too.
 
 You loved me too?
 
 Even that's a lie. She didn't know you were alive. There are things between Daisy and me that you'll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.
 
 I want to speak to Daisy alone.
 She's all excited now...
 
 Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom. It wouldn't be true.
 
 Of course it wouldn't.
 
 As if it mattered to you.
 
 Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on.
 
 You're not taking care of her any more! Daisy's leaving you.
 
 Nonsense.
 
 I am, though.
 
 She's not leaving me; and certainly not for a common swindler!
 
 Mr. Gatsby, who exactly are you anyhow? You see, I have made a small investigation into your affairs... You're one of Meyer Wolfsheim's bunch.
 
 See, he and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of 'drug stores' and sold bootlegged alcohol over the counter!
 
 What about it, old sport?
 
 Don't call me `old sport!' This drug store business is just small change compared to the bonds stunt you and Wolfsheim have got going on now.
 
 Well your friend Walter Chase isn't too proud to come in on it.
 
 I've been giving that some thought.
 How does a reputable banker like Walter Chase find himself up to his eyeballs in debt to a little kike like Wolfsheim?
 
 It's called `greed,' old sport.
 
 That's right; you've got half of Wall Street out there swilling your free booze at that fun park every weekend...
 I'm surprised he hasn't tried to drag you in...
 
 My God, he has...
 
 He's got nothing to do with-
 With your little racket...
 Daisy... Can't you see who this guy is? With his house and his parties and his fancy clothes; he's just a front for Wolfsheim, a gangster, to get his claws into respectable folk like Walter...!
 
 The only respectable thing about you, old sport, is your money, that's it, and now I've just as much as you; so that means we're equal!!
 
 Oh no, no, we're different; I am, )
 They are...
 SHE IS;
 
 we're all different from you - we were born different, it's in our blood, and nothing you do, or say, or steal or dream up, can ever change that... And a girl like Daisy will never...!
 
 SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUTTT UP!!!!
 
 Gatsby looked, in that moment... as if he had killed a man.
 
 That's right Mr. Gatsby, show us those fine Oxford manners...
 
 My sincerest apologies. I... I seem to have lost my temper.
 
 Daisy darling... None of this has any consequence. Don't listen to him Daisy.
 
 We're going back   to Louisville to be married. Then   we're going to live together in   our house; it's-
 He began talking excitedly, denying everything... But with every word Daisy was drawing further and further into herself, until only the dead dream fought on...
 
 Please Tom; I can't stand this anymore!
 
 You two start on home...
 In Mr. Gatsby's car.
 
 Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his little flirtation... is over.
 
 Daisy...!
 
 Want any of this? Jordan? Nick?
 Nick?
 
 What?
 
 Want any?
 
 No... I just remembered - today's my birthday. I'm thirty.
 
 Happy birthday...
 
 Thirty - the promise of a decade of loneliness...
 
 The formidable stroke of thirty died away, as Gatsby and Daisy drove on through the cooling twilight, towards death...
 
 God knows everything you've been doing!
 
 You might fool me but you can't fool God!
 
 God sees everything!
 
 He's here...
 
 Stop, Tom, please, stop!
 
 No...!
 
 Wreck...! Good. Wilson will have a little business at last... Let's take a look..
 
 Must we?
 
 Just a look.
 
 O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od!
  Sir. Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to step away-
 Get off me...!
 I'm fine. I'm fine.
  You knew her?
 
 No... Not really...
  Well then I have to ask you to step back.
 
 What happened...?
  She ran out `inna road. Son-of-abitch didn't even stopus car.
 I saw it! It was a yellow car; big yellow car.
 Yeah, a big yellow duezy; custom job.
 
 You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was!
 
 Pull yourself together...
 
 Listen, I just got here from New York. I was bringing you the coup .
 That yellow car wasn't mine, do you hear? I haven't seen it all afternoon.
  What color's your car?
 
 Blue, a coup ; we've come straight from New York.
 MICHAELIS Yeah, they just stopped...
  Alright... Blue.
 
 Who owns the yella' car...?
 
 Fella named Gatsby; he's a crook, George. Gives those parties the papers are always talking about...
 
 Maybe he was the one foolin' with Myrtle; maybe that's why he killed her...?
 
 Yeah. Maybe. Guy like that, who knows...
 
 Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!
 
 Gatsby. Something outta be done about a fella like that. He'll pay... Oh, he'll pay...
 
 The goddamn coward didn't even stop his car...
 
 You gonna defend him now, huh?
 
 I'll telephone for a taxi, Nick.
 Come in and have some supper while you wait...
 
 No thanks. I'll wait outside.
 
 What is the matter with you?
 
 Won't you come in, Nick?
 
 No... thanks.
 
 It's only half past nine...
 
 No. I think I've had enough... Of everyone.
 
 Hello old sport...
 
 What are you doing!?
 
 Just sitting here...
 
 Yes, I can see that.
 
 Did you see any trouble out on the road?
 
 Trouble!? That woman you ran down is dead Jay!
 
 I thought so... I told Daisy I THOUGHTS SO-
 Daisy? Do you hear yourself-
 Its better that the shock should come all at once-
 What's wrong with you!? How could you!?
 
 Please... Keep your voice down, old sport.
 
 Tom was right! You're nothing but a goddamn coward!
 
 Keep your voice down... There. Was. No. Point. In. Stopping.


 NO POINT!?
 
 It, it killed her instantly. I-
 Yes, I was there. I saw! It ripped her open!
 
 I understand-- It was... my fault.
 This woman just rushed out, as if she wanted to speak to us... It all happened so quickly. She-- I...
 tried-- to turn the wheel.
 
 She?
 
 It was Daisy?
 
 You see, after we left New York, she was very nervous. She thought driving would steady her. But this woman, she just rushed out at us.
 
 It all happened so quickly. It wasn't her fault...
 
 It was my fault. I should have taken the wheel...
 No one must know. Promise me. No one. Promise me.
 
 Jay-- You shouldn't be here. You should get out of here.
 
 No. No. No. I'm going to wait. I'll wait all night if necessary. You see, Daisy's locked herself in her room, and she's going to turn her light off and on again if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. If he tries ANY brutality whatsoever-
 Tom won't touch her. He's not even thinking about her...
 
 Oh, I don't trust him, old sport. I don't trust him.
 
 Alright. Alright... You wait here.
 I'll see if there's any commotion.
 
 Would you do that for me? Thank you. Thank you, old sport.
 
 Its going to be all right...
 
 Jay? Everything alright...?
 
 Oh, hello, old sport. Yes, yes, everything's just fine... About four o'clock she came to the window; she stood there... Then, well, she turned out the light...
 So...
 Give me a hand will you old sport?
 
 I should have told him what I had just seen. But all I could manage was...
 
 Jay... You oughtta go away.
 
 Tonight. They'll trace your car.
 
 Go away? I can't leave now. Not tonight.
 
 Do you understand that a woman has been killed--?
 
 Daisy's going to call in the morning. Then we'll make plans, to go away together.
 
 But Jay she-
 She just needs time to think...
 She'll call. In the morning. She just needs time to think.
 
 JAY--
 
 She just needs to think. She's going to call in the morning.
 
 Wait up with me? The suns almost up...
 
 That was the night he finally told me the truth. All of it.
 
 You know, I thought for awhile I had a lot of things... But the truth is... I'm empty.
 
 I suppose that's why I make things up about myself... But I`ve wanted to tell you the whole story for a long time... You see. I grew up, terribly, terribly poor, old sport.
 My folks were, well-
 He revealed his humble beginnings, his transformative voyage with Dan Cody, the war, Oxford, and how he'd joined Wolfsheim in the business...
 
 It was also that night that I became aware of Gatsby's...
 extraordinary gift for hope.
 
 ...I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out that I loved her, old sport. And that she loved me too.
 
 A gift that I have never found in any other person...
 
 I never realized just how extraordinary a nice girl could be.
 
 And which it is not likely I shall ever find again.
 
 I thought out my life with Daisy in it, trying to figure out how we could marry and struggle along on so many dollars a month...
 
 What was in the letter?
 
 The truth, the reason why after the war, I hadn't been able to return-
 I asked her to wait until I'd made something of myself. But-- She was young, there was so much pressure.
 
 You see, I felt married to her...
 That was all.
 
 It had all been for her. The house the parties, everything.
 WILSON
 God sees everything.
 
 Mr. Gatsby sir, excuse me, Chicago calling sir.
 
 Now now. Keep it open. For a personal call...
 
 A personal call? Of course.
 GARDENER I'm going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby.
 
 Not today. It's so beautiful.
 You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer?
 
 Let's go for a swim. I'll have the phone transferred to the pool...
 
 Jay, I've got to go. I have to work.
 
 I understand... Well, I'll walk you out.
 
 I'll call you up.
 
 Do, old sport, please do.
 I suppose Daisy'll call too.
 
 I suppose so... Well... Goodbye.
 
 They're a rotten crowd! You're worth the whole damn bunch put together!
 
 I was always glad I said that... It was the only compliment I ever paid him.
 
 That morning, Wall Street boomed, its usual golden roar... But I wasn't worth a decent stroke of work. I waited for Gatsby to call with news...
 
 While he waited for Daisy...
 
 Daisy...
 
 After all these years, I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day as an endless drill...
 
 ...of police and photographers and tabloid reporters.
 
 The headlines were a nightmare...
 They pinned everything on Gatsby.
 
 The affair with Myrtle...
 
 The hit and run...
 
 Everything.
 
 And there was nothing I could say except the one unutterable fact that none of it was true...
 
 Daddy's taking care of his two favorite girls...
 
 But where are we going?
 
 Just for a little trip. Just you, me, and daddy...
 
 We should go.
 
 Buchanan residence.
 
 May I speak to Mrs. Buchanan? It's Mr. Carraway, her cousin...
 
 Madame is not available.
 
 Well, when you see her, will you tell her, the funeral's tomorrow?
 
 I'm sorry, but... They have gone away.
 
 Gone away...? Do you know when they'll be back.
 
 No.
 
 Please, I know she would want to be there. If you could just get a message to her-
 I have no further information monsieur. Au revoir.
 
 Hello...? Hello!?
 
 They were careless people, Tom and Daisy. They smashed up things and people and then retreated back into their money and their vast carelessness...
 
 GET OUT! ALL OF YOU OUT! GET OUT...!!!
 
 I rang, I wrote, I implored...
 
 But not a single one of the sparkling hundreds who had enjoyed his hospitality all summer, attended the funeral...
 
 And from Daisy, not even a flower.
 
 I was all he had; the only one who cared...
 
 After Gatsby's death, New York was haunted for me...
 
 That city... My once golden...
 shimmering mirage, now made me sick.
 
 On my last night in New York... I returned to that huge, incoherent house once more.
 
 Wolfsheim's 'associates' had cleaned the place out...
 
 He threw all those parties hoping she would wander in one night...
 
 Its like an amusement park...
 
 But how do you live her all alone?
 
 She makes it look so splendid, don't you think, old sport?
 
 Music! And then we can dance all night...
 
 Will you come old sport? We... need you.
 
 I wish it could always be like this...
 
 It will be...
 
 I remembered how we had all come to Gatsby's, and guessed at his corruption... While he had stood before us concealing an incorruptible dream...
 
 Its perfect... From your perfect, irresistible imagination.
 
 The moon rose higher... And as I stood there, brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock.
 
 He had come such a long way...
 
 And his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it.
 
 He did not know that it was already behind him...
 
 Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year, recedes before us...
 
 It eluded us then, but that's no matter - tomorrow we will run faster...
 
 Stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning...
 
 So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly, into the past.
